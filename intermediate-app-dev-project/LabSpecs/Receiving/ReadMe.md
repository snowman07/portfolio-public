# Receiving Purchase Orders

## Business Process Overview


> *Employees must log onto the system. Receiving must only allow authenicated users within the Receiving Role to have access to the subsystem. An Associate or Department Head do receiving. The Employee full name must appear on the form in text mode*

Receiving purchased merchandise for resale is done usually days to weeks after the purchase order was originally placed. An outstanding purchase order has **not** been closed and has an order date. Receiving involves the manual verification of items shipped to us by the vendor against the shipping sheet. The receiver records on the shipping sheet the quantity of items received, damaged items, or items that have been sent, by accident, which were not actually on the purchase order. The shipping sheet can then be manual compared to our purchase order on file.

To start the process, all outstanding orders are displayed to the receiver. From this list the receiver will select the order that is being received. On selecting an order, the order details are displayed. This will allow the receiver to manually verify the order contents to the shipping sheet. As the receiver verifies the order, the receiver may:

- Enter the number of stock items received
- Enter the number of stock items refused and returned, a reason must be entered
- Enter items for return that are not on the original order (shipped in error).

Once the receiver has finished verifying the order and making the necessary receiving entries on the screen, a button is pressed to process the data. The data currently displayed on the screen is sent for processing by the system.

A receiver can also Force Close an order (this is a management decision). A Force Close is used when the outstanding order will not be full-filled by the supplier for one reason or another, such as the supplier has gone out of business or the product is no longer available or produced. A Force Close order must have a reason supplied.

After either Receiving or Force Close, refresh the display so a new order can be selected from the outstanding list of orders.
